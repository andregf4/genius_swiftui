# genius_swiftui
App made in SwiftUI to integrate with Gen AI (Gemini).

This app was developed with the purpose of integrating a generative artificial intelligence with Swift, iOS programming language. It's about a game of answers and questions to challenge people about general knowledge. The user has to input some data and a question (with its answer) is generated by Gemini, which is brought to the app interface after a few seconds. So, behind the scenes, there is an API request.
